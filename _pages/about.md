Hi all! I am Elise, a senior at Columbia University studying computer science and operations research. I am fortunate to be advised by [Kaizheng Wang](https://kw2934.github.io/), [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/), and [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/).

I am interested in robust and trustworthy machine learning. In particular, I have been working on: 
1. Principled data-driven decision-making to improve model robustness in real-world environments, such as under distribution shifts. 
2. Differential privacy and adversarial attacks. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
