  abstract = 	 {We investigate model assessment and selection in a changing environment, by synthesizing datasets from both the current time period and historical epochs. To tackle unknown and potentially arbitrary temporal distribution shift, we develop an adaptive rolling window approach to estimate the generalization error of a given model. This strategy also facilitates the comparison between any two candidate models by estimating the difference of their generalization errors. We further integrate pairwise comparisons into a single-elimination tournament, achieving near-optimal model selection from a collection of candidates. Theoretical analyses and empirical experiments underscore the adaptivity of our proposed methods to the non-stationarity in data.}

      abstract = {Distribution-free prediction sets play a pivotal role in uncertainty quantification for complex statistical models. Their validity hinges on reliable calibration data, which may not be readily available as real-world environments often undergo unknown changes over time. In this paper, we propose a strategy for choosing an adaptive window and use the data therein to construct prediction sets. The window is selected by optimizing an estimated bias-variance tradeoff. We provide sharp coverage guarantees for our method, showing its adaptivity to the underlying temporal drift. We also illustrate its efficacy through numerical experiments on synthetic and real data.}
